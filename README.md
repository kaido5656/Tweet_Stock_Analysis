### Database Storage
PostgreSQL is the database we intend to use, since we are working with ‘.csv’ data files. and we will integrate Tableau to display the data.


### Machine Learning
SciKitLearn or Tensorflow will be  the ML library we'll be using. Depending on what the data looks like after cleaning we will decide between a classification or a regression model.
