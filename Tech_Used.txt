##Data Cleaning and Analysis
Excel csv's will be used to import the data and Pandas will be used to clean the data and perform an exploratory analysis. Further analysis and manipulation will be completed using Python before the data is imported to our PostgresSQL database.

##Database Storage
PostgreSQL is the database we intend to use, since we are working with ‘.csv’ data files. and we will integrate Tableau to display the data.

##Machine Learning
SciKitLearn or Tensorflow will be the ML library we'll be using. Depending on what the data looks like after cleaning we will decide between a classification or a regression model. Machine Learning model diagram will be updated upon further discovery throughout the process.

##Dashboard
Our final Dashboard will be presented on Tableau with all the findings and ML predictions.
